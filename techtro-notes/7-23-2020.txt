all about "pages"

- YAML and spring/java beans (HJ)
    - Yaml syntax basics and anchor usage
        - schema, show short cut
    - Start with connecting the yaml to the backing classes
        - PagesConfiguration: annotations, YamlPropertySourceFactory
        - lombok annotations: Java beans
- PageController
    - Round trip form submission
        - GET page endpoint (CT)
            - return static page
            - returns form page
                - model pageConfiguration to render page
                - model data to present submitted inputs
        - POST page endpoint (HJ)
            - applicationData
                - session scoped bean
                - follows pages structure for storing pages data
                - "non pages" session data - submissionTime
            - validation
                - extract value from post body
                - apply the appropriate validation (from pageConfiguration for that input)
            - redirects to navigation endpoint on success
        - GET navigation endpoint (CT)
            - uses workflowConfiguration nextPage to determine next page
            - the determination of nextPage may be conditional, depending on input on current page
            - nextPage may also be skipped, depending on input from any previous pages
    - Session & flow management (HJ)
        - Configure "landmark" pages to apply special behaviors to particular pages in the overall flow
        - Landmarks
            - Landing - clears session data
            - Terminal - page after submit (end of the flow)
            - Start timer - indicates that the user has started filling out an application
            - Submit - page that performs submit
        - Session is not refreshed, rather the data in the session is cleared
    - Application submission (CT)
        - POST submit endpoint
            - Directed to from the page marked as the "Submit" landmark
            - Captures application metrics - currently just duration to complete application
